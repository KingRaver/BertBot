# Development

- `npm run dev` uses `tsx` to hot reload.
- `npm run build` outputs to `dist/`.
- `npm run start` runs the compiled server.

## Notes
- The WebChat static files are served from `src/` in dev and `dist/` in production.
- Tooling is minimal by design; add tests and hardening as you grow.
