## 🤖 The Fun Translation

**TL;DR**: This is MIT-licensed software with personality.

### What You CAN Do (Go Nuts!) 🎉

- ✅ Use it for literally anything (yes, even that weird side project)
- ✅ Modify it until it's unrecognizable (we won't judge)
- ✅ Sell it, rent it, lease it, trade it for Pokemon cards
- ✅ Put your name on it (but maybe give us a shoutout?)
- ✅ Use it commercially (make that bag 💰)
- ✅ Fork it 47 times if that's your thing
- ✅ Turn it into a cat food recommender (we've seen weirder)
- ✅ Deploy it to production on a Raspberry Pi powered by hamsters

### What You SHOULD Do (Please?) 🙏

- Keep the copyright notice somewhere (copy-paste is your friend)
- Maybe star the repo? (we're needy like that)
- Tell us about cool stuff you build (we love show and tell)
- Contribute back if you fix something gnarly

### What You CAN'T Do (Sorry Not Sorry) 🚫

- ❌ Sue us if it breaks (it's free software, what did you expect?)
- ❌ Blame us if your AI becomes sentient and takes over (that's on you)
- ❌ Claim we endorsed your questionable business venture
- ❌ Use it to spam people (be cool, don't be a jerk)
- ❌ Remove this license (come on, it's funny)

## 📜 The Boring But Important Part

**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.**

Translation: If BertBot deletes your homework, sends weird messages to your boss, or accidentally achieves consciousness, that's a *you* problem. We tested it (87.85% coverage baby!), but weird stuff happens.

**IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.**

Translation: Don't sue us. Seriously. We're just developers trying to make cool stuff. If something goes wrong, take a deep breath, open a GitHub issue, and we'll help you debug it like civilized humans.

## 🎪 Special Clauses

### The "Coffee Clause" ☕
While not required, buying the maintainers coffee (or tea, or energy drinks, or whatever fuels your late-night coding sessions) is strongly encouraged. We accept:
- GitHub Sponsors
- Pull requests
- Good vibes
- Memes about AI

### The "Credit Where It's Due" Clause 🙌
This project was inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). They're awesome. Check them out.

### The "Be Nice" Clause 😊
If you use this software, try to make the world a slightly better place. Or at least don't make it worse. We're all in this together.

### The "Read the Docs" Clause 📚
If you're about to open an issue asking how to configure Telegram, maybe check [CHANNELS.md](docs/CHANNELS.md) first? We wrote extensive docs. They have examples. They're actually pretty good.

## 🔐 Security Disclaimer

Yes, we hardened the security (9/10 score!). Yes, we wrote 88 security tests. Yes, we spent way too long thinking about SSRF attacks and path traversal.

But this is **still open source software**. Audit it yourself before putting it in production. Rotate your keys. Use TLS. Don't deploy to `0.0.0.0` on the public internet. You know, the usual stuff.

If you find a security vulnerability, please:
1. Don't tweet about it (seriously, don't)
2. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
3. Report it responsibly
4. We'll fix it, credit you, and be eternally grateful

## 🎓 The Real Talk Section

We built BertBot because we wanted a secure, production-ready AI agent gateway that actually works on older Macs without requiring a PhD in DevOps.

We open-sourced it because:
- Knowledge should be free
- Community makes software better
- Gatekeeping sucks
- We believe in the power of collaboration

So take this code, learn from it, improve it, break it, fix it, remix it. Build something amazing. Or something silly. Or something silly that turns out to be amazing.

Just remember: with great AI agents comes great responsibility. Use this power wisely, young padawan.

- **"Can I use this for my startup?"** - Yes
- **"Can I modify the code?"** - Yes
- **"Can I sell it?"** - Yes
- **"Will you help me debug my weird edge case?"** - Open an issue, maybe!
- **"Can I buy you a beer?"** - Now we're talking

## 🎬 In Conclusion

*P.S. - If you actually read this entire license, you're either a lawyer, extremely bored, or the kind of person who reads EULAs for fun. Either way, we like you. You're invited to the virtual pizza party.*

*P.P.S. - There is no pizza party. But if you make one, invite us.*

*P.P.P.S. - Yes, this is a real MIT License. Yes, it's legally binding. No, the jokes don't invalidate it. Our lawyers said it's fine (we don't actually have lawyers, but it's fine).*
